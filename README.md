# Spanish Accent Character Hotkey Extension
This is a simple Chrome Extension that mirrors [SpanishDict's](https://www.spanishdict.com/) hotkeys. Hold down on a specific character to use the accent form instead in a selected input/textarea.

This was tested primarly on Duolingo, as I was annoyed on having to move my hand away from the keyboard to click on the respective accent character when doing lessons.
